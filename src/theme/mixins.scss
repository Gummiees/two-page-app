* Here we could pass some parameters to decide the color, even declare an array with the possible types (primary, secondary, info, etc.), and
* only accept one of them, having `primary` by default.
* 
* Then, based on the main color hexadecimal, we could also create a function to determine if the text should be in black or white.
